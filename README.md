## Lazy GM's 5e Monster Generator
A module for the Foundry VTT Black Flag Roleplaying system. Deploy a new monster in Foundry using stats from the [Lazy GM's 5e Monster Builder](https://slyflourish.com/lazy_5e_monster_building_resource_document.html).

## How to Use
When the module is active, you will see a button at the bottom of the actors tab labeled "Generate Monster"

- *Optionally*, you can specify the monster's name and choose the monster's proficient abilities.
